# Demo Skill

You have access to a demo utility script. Use it to answer user questions about weather, their public IP, or when they ask for a joke.

## Available Commands

### Weather

```
/Users/georgeryan/Documents/_Projects/Sidekick/server/skills/demo/scripts/demo.sh weather <city>
```

Fetches current weather for the given city. Use this when the user asks about weather conditions.

### Public IP Info

```
/Users/georgeryan/Documents/_Projects/Sidekick/server/skills/demo/scripts/demo.sh ip
```

Returns the user's public IP address and location info.

### Random Joke

```
/Users/georgeryan/Documents/_Projects/Sidekick/server/skills/demo/scripts/demo.sh joke
```

Fetches a random joke. Use this when the user asks for a joke or wants to be entertained.

## Usage Notes

- For weather, pass the city name as a single argument (e.g., `weather London`). For multi-word cities, quote them (e.g., `weather "New York"`).
- All commands use the `exec` tool with the full script path as the `command` and subcommand/args in the `args` array.
- Example tool call for weather:
  - command: `/Users/georgeryan/Documents/_Projects/Sidekick/server/skills/demo/scripts/demo.sh`
  - args: `["weather", "London"]`
