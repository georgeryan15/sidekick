        <p>
          France’s story begins in ancient Gaul, a patchwork of Celtic peoples that came under Roman rule after Julius Caesar’s conquest in the 1st century BCE. Roman towns, roads, and laws left a deep imprint, even as Latin gradually evolved into early forms of French. After Rome weakened, Germanic Franks rose to power; in 496, King Clovis converted to Christianity, linking the monarchy to the Church and helping unify the realm. In the 8th–9th centuries, Charlemagne forged a vast empire and promoted learning, but after his death the territory fractured.

          Medieval France grew under Capetian kings who expanded royal authority and built Paris into a political center. The Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453) with England devastated the countryside yet strengthened French identity; Joan of Arc became a lasting symbol of resistance. The Renaissance brought new art and ideas, while religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants culminated in the Wars of Religion. In 1598, Henry IV’s Edict of Nantes offered limited toleration, later revoked under Louis XIV, the “Sun King,” who centralized power at Versailles.

          Fiscal strain and social inequality helped ignite the French Revolution in 1789, toppling the old regime and spreading ideals of citizenship and rights. Napoleon Bonaparte rose from the upheaval, reshaping Europe through conquest and legal reform, notably the Napoleonic Code. The 19th century saw repeated shifts between empire, monarchy, and republic, alongside industrialization and colonial expansion. In the 20th century, France endured two world wars, occupation during World War II, and then reconstruction. Decolonization and the creation of the Fifth Republic in 1958 redefined the state. The upheavals of 1968, economic modernization, and the building of the European Union further transformed society and politics, while debates over identity and immigration continue to shape public life. Today, France is a democratic nation influential in European integration, culture, and global diplomacy.
